    <p>
        Thank you for visiting Community Ally. Please read our Terms of Service and

        of the most important concepts of our time. Pursuant to modifications of
        Terms of Service effective September 16, 2020, Community Ally is making
        proactive and substantial steps to both protect user privacy, and to provide
        users more control over their own data.

        subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service

            <u>5. Accessing, Editing, and Removing Your Information</u>
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Users may in some cases be able to review and edit the personal information
        they have provided to us by logging into your account on the Site and
        editing their account. Although most changes may occur immediately,
        information may still be stored in a web browser's cache. We take no
        responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices
        that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such. In
        addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you
        in our backup and/or database.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>6. Cookies</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not use cookies on the site to do any sort of tracking, but some
        third-party providers do, such as Stripe for payment. For this reason, it
        is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser, and you hereby
        acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies and that you
        consent to our use of cookies in relation to your computer system.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>7. Third Party Websites</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Community Ally may post links to third party websites on its Site. These
        third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by
        Community Ally, and you release us from any liability for the conduct of
        these third party websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place,
        in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third
        parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to
        members of the Service or Site. Community Ally bears no responsibility for
        the information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website.
        Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you
        visit through third party links.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>8. Third Party Access to Your Information</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although you are entering into an Agreement with Community Ally to disclose
        your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations
        to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others. We will always
        do our best to protect your information and avoid third-party providers
        that are untrustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may
        delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your
        information. For example, our web host stores the information that you
        provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or
        assist us in securing our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in
        the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this
        Privacy Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every
        authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant
        to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the
        services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or
        otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or
        systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these
        third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for
        their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly
        should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to
        collect, share, store, exchange, and otherwise use your information in
        conjunction with:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            Zopim – Technical support, receives your email address
        </li>
        <li>
            Postmark – Email delivery, receives your name and email address
        </li>
        <li>
            Amazon – Stores your documents
        </li>
        <li>
            Microsoft – Hosts our website
        </li>
        <li>
            WePay – Processes resident payments
        </li>
        <li>
            Stripe – Processes premium plan payments
        </li>
        <li>
            Dwolla – Processes resident payments
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><u>9. Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This probably will not happen, but we need to comply with the law. At times
        it may become necessary or desirable to Community Ally, for legal purposes,
        to release your information in response to a request from a government
        agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your
        information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is
        desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal
        investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a
        subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an
        opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to
        quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also
        proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties
        where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our
        belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from
        any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your
        information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private
        litigants.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>10. Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communications
        with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file
        complaints concerning unsolicited e-mails from Community Ally since, by
        providing such information, you agree to receive communications from us or
        anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy. However, you may unsubscribe
        from certain communications by notifying Community Ally that you no longer
        wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove
        you from the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>11. Security Measures</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We take certain measures to enhance the security of our Site and Service,
        including using SSL certificates. However, we make no representations as to
        the security or privacy of your information. It is in our interest to keep
        our website secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software,
        firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats.
