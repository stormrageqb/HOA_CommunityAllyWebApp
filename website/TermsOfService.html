    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for visiting Community Ally and its suite of tools. Please read
        these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy carefully, as you must agree to

        modifications of Terms of Service effective September 16, 2020, Community
        Ally is making proactive and substantial steps to both protect user
        privacy, and to provide users more control over their own data.

        <strong><u>2. Definitions</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout this Agreement, we may use certain words or phrases, and it is
        important that you understand the meaning of them. The list is not
        all-encompassing and no definition should be considered binding to the
        point that it renders this Agreement nonsensical:

        Club Ally, Neighborhood Ally, PTA Ally); our Service; or a combination of
        all or some of the preceding definitions depending on the context in which
        the word is used;

        <strong><u>3. How Community Ally Works</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Community Ally provides tools to help community organizations and citizens
        improve their community. Condo Ally, HOA Ally, and Townhome Ally, for
        example, provide an online platform for associations to perform their
        management duties in a way that is tracked and open to all residents of the
        association. Users can pay their association assessment payments online
        through a third party payment provider. Beyond that, associations can
        obtain quotes from professionals for work to be done and can connect with
        other community organizations.

        RELEASING US FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO YOU IN
        RELATION TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES, FOR REASONS
        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FAILURE OF OUR SERVICE, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY

        LIABILITY, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY LIABLE TO YOU FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT
        OF DAMAGES THAT THE LAW RESTRICTS OUR LIABILITY TO, IF SUCH A MINIMUM
        EXISTS.
    </p>
    <p>
        YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY
        THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY USE OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PEOPLE
        WHO COMMIT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, DEFAMATION, TORTIOUS

    <p>
        YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES

    </p>
    <p>
        THE PROVISION OF OUR SERVICE TO YOU IS CONTINGENT ON YOUR AGREEMENT WITH
        THIS AND ALL OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THE PROVISIONS OF
        THIS "REPRESENTATIONS &amp; WARRANTIES" SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT
        THE GENERALITY OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            <strong>
                For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability:
            </strong>
        </em>
        Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has
        provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above
        then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.
        Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim
        liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence or
        that of any of our officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent
        misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude
        either now or in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT
        REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA
        RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY
        OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, "A GENERAL RELEASE
        DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO
        EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF
        KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT
        WITH THE DEBTOR." YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL
        CODE. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE
        THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.

    </p>
    <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims by you or any
        third party which may arise from or relate to this Agreement or the
        provision of our service to you, including any damages caused by your use
        of our Site or acceptance of the offers contained on it. You also agree
        that you have a duty to defend us against such claims and we may require
        you to pay for an attorney(s) of our choice in such cases. You agree that
        this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for our reasonable
        attorneys' fees, court costs, and disbursements. In the event of a claim
        such as one described in this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the
        party/parties making the claim, and you shall be liable for the damages as
        though we had proceeded with a trial.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>22. Choice of Law</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the State of
        Illinois. The offer and acceptance of this contract are deemed to have
        occurred in the State of Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>23. Forum of Dispute</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will
        be heard solely by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of
        Illinois. Specifically, where the subject matter of a dispute is eligible
        for it, you agree that any disputes shall be heard solely within the lowest
        civil court of competent jurisdiction in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
        State of Illinois ("Small Claims Court").
    </p>
    <p>
        If a dispute alleges multiple claims and one or more of those claims would
        be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Court, you agree not to bring
        the other claims against us and to instead proceed within the Small Claims
        Court.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would be entitled in a dispute to an amount exceeding the monetary
        jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, you agree to waive your right to
        collect any damages in excess of the monetary jurisdiction and instead
        still bring your claim within the Small Claims Court.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that if a dispute is eligible to be heard in Small Claims Court
        but you would be entitled to an additional or alternative remedy in a
        higher court, such as injunctive relief, you will waive your right to that
        remedy and still bring the dispute within the Small Claims Court.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this
        section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will
        be responsible for our reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
        disbursements in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that the unsuccessful party in any dispute arising from or
        relating to this Agreement will be responsible for the reimbursement of the
        successful party's reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
        disbursements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>24. Class Action Waiver</u></strong>
        <u> </u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Any dispute under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an
        individual basis; class/representative/collective actions are not
        permitted. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIM(S) AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR
        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE
        CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF
        A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>25. Force Majeure</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may
        otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our
        control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection,
        riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful
        strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption,
        unavailability of payment processors, failure or shortage of
        infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our
        control.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>26. Severability</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful,
        conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise
        unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been
        entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with
        each other's operation, Community Ally shall have the sole right to elect
        which provision remains in force.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>27. Non-Waiver</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Community Ally reserves all rights afforded to us under this Agreement as
        well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of
        any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable
        law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same
        provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>28. Termination &amp; Cancellation</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Community Ally reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate
        your access to the Site and the related services or any portion thereof at

        <strong><u>29<strong>. Assignment of Rights</strong></u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to
        any other party without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights
        and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our
        discretion.

    <p>
        <strong><u>30. Amendments</u></strong>
        <u></u>
